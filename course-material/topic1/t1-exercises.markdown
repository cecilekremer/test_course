[Github gist](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35852062/using-jekyll-how-to-effectively-store-code-samples) can also be used to include code snippets.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight R %}
print("Hello World!")
{% endhighlight %}
